*** CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS ***
- It is helpful to develop and implement advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms to solve    complex financial problems. Here are the steps to be follow:
**step-1: Understand the Problem**
- The probability that someone/somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.

**Key Objectives**
- To build a model that borrowers can use to help make best financial decisions.

**step-2: Data Collection**
- To build this model we have taken a dataset from kaggle competition.

**Data Cleaning**
- Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicate records. Address inconsistencies and standardize data formats.

**Feature Engineering**
- Identify and select the most relevant features to improve model performance and reduce overfitting. Create new features through transformations, interactions, or aggregations to capture hidden patterns.

**step-3: Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data science process where you explore and analyze datasets to uncover underlying patterns, relationships, and insights before formal modeling or hypothesis testing. The goal of EDA is to gain a better understanding of the data, identify any anomalies or outliers, and develop hypotheses about the data's structure.

**Statistical Summary**
- Calculate summary statistics like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.Understand the central tendency and dispersion of the data.

**Visualization**
- Use plots like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts to visualize the distribution of variables, relationships between variables, and identify outliers.

**step-4: Model Selection and Design**
- Model selection and design are crucial steps in the machine learning workflow. These processes involve choosing the most appropriate model for a given problem and designing it to optimize performance. Both steps require a deep understanding of the problem, the data, and the strengths and limitations of various models.

**step-5: Model Training and Evaluation**
- Model training and evaluation are essential steps in the machine learning pipeline, where the selected model is trained on data and its performance is assessed to ensure it meets the desired criteria. These steps involve optimizing the model parameters, preventing overfitting, and validating the model’s ability to generalize to new data.
- Divide the dataset into training and validation (or testing) sets. Typically, 70-80% of the data is used for training, and the remaining 20-30% is for validation/testing.
- Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and confusion matrix, depending on the problem’s needs.
